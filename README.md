# Twitter Space UI in Flutter 

A simple UI implementation of how the Twitter Space UI feature could be implemented using Flutter.

This sample project shows:
- a list of Twitter users
- ability to randomly show emoji notifications (one per user in a periodic fashion)
- Twitter Space emoji selector (for only one user - demo)
- displayed in a modal fashion
